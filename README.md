A dataset license generator for dataset publishers

## **Questionnaire Format**

**Answer all the questions in the 3 steps to get your custom data license.**

## **1. For Data itself**

## 1.1 Can users themselves make the Data available to other third parties?

Answering "Yes" gives the right to distribute the data, i.e. to make all or part of the Data available to Third Parties under the same terms as those you will choose.

## 1.2 Can users create labels, tags or create subsets of the Data?

Answering "Yes" gives the right to create Labelled Data, meaning the creation of associated metadata and informational content derived from Data which identify, comment or otherwise derive information from Data, such as tags and labels.

## 1.3 Can users create a Representation based on the Data?

A Representation means a Model existing in a different form, format or model that mimics the effects of the Data, but that does not contain any individual data points or allow third parties to infer individual data points with currently existing technology.

## **2. For Model**

## 2.1 Can the Data be used in conjunction with Models?

Answering "No" means that the Data is made available for viewing and evaluation only, without any further right to use it in conjunction with Models.

## 2.2 Can users perform Research?

"Research" means to access the Data, use the Data to create or improve Models, but without the right to use the Output or resulting Trained Model for any purpose other than evaluating the Model Research under the same terms. Note that the next question pertains to making the results of the Research available (i.e. publishing them).

## 2.3 Can the Research be published?

This means the right to make available to Third Parties the Models resulting from Research, provided however that third parties accessing such Trained Models have the right to use them for Research or Publication only. Note that there are additional rights that can be granted through the following questions.

## 2.4 Can the Trained Models be used for Internal Purposes?

The Output can be used internally for any purpose, but not necessarily made available to Third Parties or for their benefit. Note that the ability to make available to third Parties or use for their benefit can be restricted in later questions, but if you do not grant the right to use for Internal Purposes, then the other subsequent rights are not granted either.

## 2.5 Can users commercialize the Output?

Output means the results of operating a Trained Model. Commercialization means to make the Output available to third parties or for their benefit (but does not include the right to make the Trained Model available).

## 2.6 Can users commercialize the Trained Models?

Answering "Yes" means allowing the right to make the Trained Model itself available to a third party, or embodying the Trained Model in a product or service that is distributed, with or without direct access to the Output for such third party.
